# Liver_Disease_Prediction

This project focuses on building and evaluating various machine learning models to predict liver disease. Using a dataset of patient health records, the models are trained and optimized to achieve the highest possible accuracy. The models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost Classifier.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:
- 'Liver_Disease_Prediction.ipynb' : Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and model training.
- 'Indian_Liver_Patients.csv' : Dataset used for training and testing the models.
- 'Requirements.txt' - List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature scaling.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Each model is trained using a grid search for hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation to ensure robust performance. The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy confusion matrix and classification report.

## How to use
- Clone this repository
git clone
- Install the necessary dependencies.

## Future Work
- Further tuning of hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
- Exploration of additional models such as neural networks.
- Incorporation of more advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Deployment of the best model using a web application for real-time predictions.
